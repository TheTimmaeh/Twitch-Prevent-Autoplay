# Twitch Prevent Autoplay v0.2
This userscript alters the parameters of embedded Twitch players to overwrite both the default autoplay setting and the intentional autoplay setting.

# Setup
## 1. Install Tampermonkey
To execute the userscript in your browser, I recommend using [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/). Tampermonkey provides an environment to create, store and execute userscripts in your browser.

## 2. Install Twitch Prevent Autoplay v0.2
Once Tampermonkey is set up and ready, click [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheTimmaeh/Twitch-Prevent-Autoplay/master/tpa.user.js) to start the install process of the userscript. Tampermonkey recognizes the userscript and offers you to install it. Once installed there's nothing else to do.

## 3. Enjoy!
